# My Custom Web Scraper

This is a custom-built web scraper framework in Python designed to crawl websites, parse their content, and save the extracted data. It is structured to mimic some of the functionalities of Scrapy but is designed to be simple, modular, and easy to extend.

## Features
- Asynchronous web crawling using `aiohttp`.
- Data parsing using `BeautifulSoup`.
- Support for middleware (such as rotating user agents).
- Item pipelines for processing scraped data.
- Command-line interface (CLI) for easy configuration and usage.
